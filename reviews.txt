Subject: <Name> – blurb to include <Their Product/Blog/ Book Name> 

Hi <Name> -

I love what you've been doing with <Product/ Blog Name> [ALTERNATE: I recently read your <Book Name> book and appreciated your thoughts on…]

I'll keep this short because I'm sure you're busy.

I'm preparing to publish a book entitled " Influencing Virtual Teams: 17 Tactics that Get Things Done with your Remote Employees. "

It just came back from the second round of editing and I'm designing a professional cover at this stage.

I thought I'd ask if you're interested in getting an advance copy of the manuscript (it's a short book), and if you end up liking what you read, to have a short blurb written by you included in the book marketing materials.

This would give you some exposure to <Their Product/ Blog/ Book Name> and hopefully, get you a few customers.

A little about me: I'm a senior leader at Cisco Systems, and I've conducted some graduate research related to this space.

My audience is not huge, but I'll be marketing the book heavily to I.T. managers at Fortune 500 corporations, which is my target audience. I'll also be initially launching the book for free through Amazon (especially to large tech organizations), and I already have a few big companies interested.

If you're not interested or you don't have the time, I totally understand and no worries at all.

Kindly let me know!

Hi <Name> -

I just wanted to follow up on the email I sent several days ago because I haven't heard back.

(I don't want to bother you if you're too busy, so I will not send you any more follow-up emails, but I just wanted to make sure you received the original email below).

Great! Thanks for the reply <Name>.

I've attached the manuscript along with this email (please keep it private because it's not published yet).

A couple of quick points:

• The book is a quick read (less than 50 pages), but if you don't have a lot of time, skimming through Chapters 1 to 5 should give you a good flavor of it.

• The book's audience is going to be managers and directors at large global companies who manage remote employees.

• The blurb is just one or two sentences about why you think the book is helpful to readers.

• If you can send your feedback by Thursday, July 16, that'll be great (and if you need a bit more time than that, please let me know).

Thanks again,

Hassan

Message A-06: Response when they send a testimonial 

Subject: Re: <Name> – blurb to include <Their Product/Blog/ Book Name> 

Hi <Name> - 
This is perfect! Thank you so much for the kind words.

A couple of things:

• Could you please send me a high-resolution headshot picture of you that I can use?

• I have your role/ title listed as "Bestselling author of <Book Name>" to add next to your testimonial. Would this work? If not, please let me know your preferred title.

• I might edit the testimonial a little bit for clarity or space, depending on where your blurb will end up. Please let me know if that's okay with you and if you'd like to read the final version before I publish it.

Thanks again for your feedback – I appreciate it.

Regards,

Hassan


Message A-07: Final response when they send a testimonial

Subject: Re: <Name> – blurb to include <Their Product/Blog/ Book Name> 

Hi <Name> -

Thanks for sending the picture and role confirmation. And thank you for agreeing to have me modify the testimonial a little bit.

I'll be adding your testimonial to a few marketing materials, including a couple of webpages and potentially the book's content. So I might use different versions of the blurb depending on space (I'll share any links with you when the testimonials are out).

We're all set for now.

When the book is published, I'll also send you a link to the book so you can download it for free and upload your review to Amazon (if it's not too much to ask).

Thanks again.

I have a quick question.

Could you kindly upload your testimonial to Amazon (if it's not too much to ask)?

It'll take less than a minute, and doing so will have your feedback appear in a couple of places on Amazon.

Subject: Interested in a review copy of a new book about email?

Hi <Name> -

I've been writing a new book entitled " Don't Reply All: 18 Email Tactics That Help You Write Better Emails and Improve Communication with Your Team."

It is a super-short book (takes less than 45 minutes to read) about how to communicate better through email.

It's in the editing phase at this point.

If you rely on email when working with a team, I wanted to ask if you're interested in getting a free advance copy of the manuscript and, if you end up liking what you read, to write a short review on Amazon.

Your review might also be included in the book marketing materials (only if you're interested).

My previous book, " Influencing Virtual Teams" became a #1 Amazon Bestseller and was highlighted by folks like Tom Moor (co-founder of Buffer) and Stephane Kasriel (ex-CEO of Upwork).

If you're interested, simply respond to this email with a simple " Yes, I'm interested in an advance review copy, " and I'll follow up with you directly.

If not, please ignore this email!

Thank you,

- Hassan

P.S. Due to Amazon's recent rules, you'll need to have an active account on Amazon (i.e., you've bought something worth $50 or more from their site in the past year) to be able to leave a review of the book.

Would you be interested in an advance review copy now (a PDF file) or the Amazon Kindle version when it's out?

In either case, I will send you the Amazon link to download the free copy so that your review appears verified, but I thought I'd ask if you'd like a PDF copy now so you have more time to read.

A couple of quick points:

• The book is super-short and should take you less than 45 minutes to read

• Please keep in mind that the book was written for people who are not very experienced with email communication, so if you already have a lot of experience, you might find the tips obvious/ common sense :) When the book is published, I'll send you the link to download the book on Amazon and upload your review.
